# Welcome to Toby Tuan Nguyen (aka _Toshi_) personal page

> Here is what I would like you to know about me.

## About me

- Senior Data Engineer with 7 years' experience building cloud data platforms and automation systems across finance, e-commerce, and consultancy
- Delivered production pipelines, Azure/AWS infrastructure-as-code, and AI-integrated workflows at scale, with proven outcomes including £300M+ GMV campaign support, reliability improvements, and GDPR-aligned delivery across multi-region teams (London, Berlin, Singapore)
- I enjoy building reliable systems that make teams faster (and yes, I still code at night)
